								<p>Welcome to Part Two of our article about how a company can maximise it's chances of being successful after receiving VC funding. If you missed Part One, it's available here: <a href="http://www.akascia.com/ak_web_articles/2015/funded_now_what.html" target="_blank">You've been funded, now what (Part One)?</a></p>
									<h2 class="ak_heading">3. Communication and culture</h2>
									<p>A lot of effort and focus goes in to a startup raising money and landing a big VC financing round but it's important to not lose that momentum and let the collective foot come off the gas. Ask yourself, what's the end goal now? How has it changed? Does the management team know? Is everyone on board with that goal? If not, how do you change it?<br>
									<br>
									<a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/how-to/funding/2014/10/3-dos-and-3-don-ts-after-you-land-vc-funding.html?page=all" target="_blank">Clate Mask</a> writes that the funding should change how your company operates or its culture, <q>Raising money shouldn't inject a lot of changes in your company. If there are changes, clearly communicate to your employees how they will affect everyone.</q> He continues, <q>Make sure your employees understand that the company isn't being sold and the culture you've created won't be going away. Clearly communicate the changes that the funding will precipitate and explain why it's a good thing for everyone.</q></p>
									<h2 class="ak_heading">4. Keep your feet on the ground</h2>
									<p>It's probably true that right now you are currently the hot new kid on the block that everyone wants to talk to and interview; no doubt Forbes and WSJ are phoning you as you read this to asking to put you on their next cover.<br>
										<br>
									But just remember, the startup and tech industry is fickle and it doesn't take much for you to being making the headlines for the wrong reasons over the next few years. So be humble, remember those who've helped you get this far.  Eric Jackson, Managing Partner at Ironfire Capital, says in <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericjackson/2011/12/14/top-ten-reasons-why-vc-backed-companies-fail/" target="_blank">this article</a> with Forbes, <q>Always keep a healthy dose of humility — no matter how many Business 2.0 and Red Herring writers laud you as the Second Coming.</q><br>
									<br>
									A feeling echoed by Matt Fates, a partner at Ascent Venture Partners in <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/11/10/10-things-to-do-when-you-get-funding/" target="_blank">this interview</a>, <q>Thank any customers or partners who were helpful during due diligence, and make sure they are up to date on your expanded plans and potential. The people you leaned on to get to this point most likely will be valuable resources going forward.</q><br>
									<br>
									In our experience, most CEOs are some of the most approachable, easy-going and open people we know, albeit often completely emerged in their business. However, there are some who certainly get a little arrogant, start believing their own hype and ultimately forget that they were once scrabbling around for their first customers and trying to get people to listen to them.<br>
									<br>
									Remember: don't believe you have all the answers and make sure you learn from your mistakes. Be your own worst critic.</p>
									<h2 class="ak_heading">5. Stay Lean</h2>
									<p>Don't lose your startup mentality towards spending, <q>Remember this is expensive capital. Make it last. Spend what you have to, when you have to, and no sooner</q> writes Matt Fates.<br>
										<br>
									Clate Mask feels that it is key to understand that this money is not the answer to all your problems, <q>You don't want to change your spending habits. You want to change your investment habits. Throwing money at problems might be tempting, but it's likely not going to be any sort of long-term answer. It's better to think about how you are investing in your customers and your company. What things can you spend on now that will pay off down the road?</q><br>
									<br>
									He continues, <q>Don't allow your company to become fat and happy. It would be a sad mistake to lose your competitive fire and entrepreneurial drive because there is money in the bank. Don't let your company get tripped up by the potential pitfalls of success.</q></p>
									<h2 class="ak_heading">6. Use your Investors</h2>
									<p>Ashish Rangnekar, the co-founder of BenchPrep says in <a href="http://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/7-things-to-do-after-raising-money.html" target="_blank">this interview with Jeff Haden</a> at Inc.com says, <q>Make your investors part of your tactical decision-making process. During prefunding, you spend a lot of time talking to investors. Once you close, it's tempting to want to get back to work and focus on customers and building products, etc.</q><br>
										<br>
									<q>We scheduled the first official meeting four months after closing. That was too late. In those four months, we lost at least two months of valuable time where they could have helped make decisions and make a positive impact. Call an all-hands, follow-on in one room, within the first four weeks.</q><br>
									<br>
									How much added-value is your VC giving you? Just the money, or are they on-call if you need help and advice? How much involvement do they want? Are they too involved? Drew Houston points out, <q>If your VCs are running the company, you're doing it wrong,</q> he said adding, <q>They're not your babysitters.</q></p>
									<h2 class="ak_heading">What about you?</h2>
									<p>What do you think about this article? What important points do you think  we've missed? What do you agree or disagree with? We'd love to make this in to a Wiki-style answer on Quora for future reference, to be continually developed and contributed to. Please leave your comments below; good or bad, we'd love to hear them!</p>
