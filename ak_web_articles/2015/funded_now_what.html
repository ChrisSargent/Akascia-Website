									<p>Congratulations, you've just secured a major round of funding; you've already beaten the odds to get  this far, of which you should be very proud. Clearly, you have demonstrated the passion and tenacity required to convince your investors you have the potential to deliver a great return. Ben Holmes from Index Ventures <a href="http://blog.ben.vc/" target="_blank">in his blog</a> writes, <q>I often say that the best indicator of how much an entrepreneur can achieve post-fundraising is how much they have been able to achieve with no capital.</q> A positive sign for you, but with only 20% of VC funded companies delivering a significant return, it's fair to say that the hard work really starts now.<br>
										<br>
										You've likely put a huge amount of time and energy into your fundraising and now your biggest challenge is to fulfil the potential that your investors believe in. What's standing in your way, what should you focus on to maximise your success and how can you ensure everything you're doing is taking you closer to that goal?<br>
										<br>										
										There's already a lot written about how startups get funding but not as much about what happens once they've got that funding. Hence, we've curated some of the best articles and interviews we could find about which topics other CEOs and VCs have cited as being important for their post-funding success. Here's the first part (you can sign up to receive the 2nd part at the top of the screen or end of the article).<br>
									<br>
									<i>Note: There's also a lot said about hiring and putting the right team together, but we've deliberately tried to steer clear of it because we think the focus on talent has been well written already.</i>									</p>
									<h2 class="ak_heading">In Perspective</h2>
									<p>Venture capitalists invest approximately $50 billion a year in about 5500 funding rounds globally. But this sudden injection of cash is by no means a guarantee of the success of those companies and the statistics are not necessarily on their side either. There are typically only about 100 IPOs and 620 M&amp;As globally each year and in the US, the average amount raised prior to IPO in 2013 was a substantial $100.9 million. Studies have shown that 1 in 5 of their investments result in a significant return, with about 2 in 5 failing and the remaining 2 in 5 returning moderate amounts (sources: <a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443720204578004980476429190" target="_blank">WSJ</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.nvca.org/index.php?Itemid=147" target="_blank">National VC Association</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-venture-capital-insights-2013-year-end/$FILE/EY-venture-capital-insights-2013-year-end.pdf" target="_blank">Venture Capital Insights® 2013</a>).<br>
									</p>
									<h2 class="ak_heading">1. Leadership and Focus</h2>
									<p>Drew Houston, CEO of Dropbox said in this interview with Pando Daily about <a href="http://pando.com/2013/02/21/dropboxs-drew-houston-on-what-to-do-right-after-you-get-funding/" target="_blank">what to do right after you get funding</a>, a founder needs to assert a sense of leadership, to convey that you have a vision, and have a plan to execute it. <q>Our goal in the early days was to establish a track record that we knew what we were doing, and to show that if we said we were going to do something we were going to do it,</q> he said. And once you get into a groove, the company shouldn't meander, <q>Part of the role for you as CEO or founder is to stop and say, 'Where are we going to be in the next one or three months?' And then next month, you look. Are we there?</q><br>
										<br>
										Jason Lemkin, one of the most prolific (and one of our favourite) writers on startups, encourages people in this post about <a href="http://saastr.com/2013/01/29/from-initial-traction-to-initial-scale-10m-in-arr-dont-get-killed-by-your-success/" target="_blank">getting to $10M ARR</a> to keep their focus on the end goal to help push them through. <q>This is the gritty phase, when you fight it out to get to scale. Scale has its own issues. Politics begin to creep in, and you can’t be as loose and fluid as you were back in the day. Releases take longer, things can seem less nimble, post-scale. But it’s much, much easier as founders when you’ve got 50+ strong folks working with you to make it happen, on top of an engine that’s humming.</q><br>
										<br>
										<q>Just get there. And your success will then be inevitable</q>.
									</p>
									<h2 class="ak_heading">2. Review the core business that got you here</h2>
									<p>You've got this far and secured this investment likely for a mix of several reasons.<br>
										<br>
										&bull; Team<br>
										&bull; Product / Technology<br>
										&bull; Customers<br>
										&bull; Traction<br>
										<br>
										So maybe now is the time to revisit each of these reasons and evaluate how you can continue to maximise each one.</p>
									<h3 class="ak_heading">The Team</h3>
									<p>For the management team you have, is everyone in the right job? Does everyone know what they have to do? Do they all understand the culture? Can they build a team of people with that same culture? Is anyone showing signs of believing &ldquo;we've made it&rdquo; after your funding?<br>
										<br>
										Should you move people around to make better use of their skills? Are their any holes in your experience or expertise that will be critical for your growth? How are you going to fill them? Often VCs will have in-house expertise dedicated to helping you plug those gaps or finding someone who can.<br>
										<br>
										In this article about <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericjackson/2011/12/14/top-ten-reasons-why-vc-backed-companies-fail/" target="_blank">why VC-backed companies fail</a>, Eric Jackson also warns against bringing in too many people who think exactly the same way, <q>Don't get left with a very one-sided way of looking at the world – or 'groupthink' on the management team. The best management teams are the ones that can actively debate issues — and may the best logic carry the day.</q> </p>
									<h3 class="ak_heading">Customers</h3>
									<p>On The Business Journals in an article about <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/how-to/funding/2014/10/5-things-i-ve-learned-since-big-time-vcs-invested.html?page=all" target="_blank">things he's learned since big-time VCs invested in his company</a>, Clate Mask, CEO of InfusionSoft maintains that keeping existing customers happy is one of his highest priorities, <q>It's critically important not to lose sight of your existing customers. Use that money to create better experiences for the customers you have, and think of ways to invest in new customer acquisition possibilities.</q><br>
										<br>
										Most people are familiar with Aaron Ross' <a href="http://predictablerevenue.com/" target="_blank">Predictable Revenue</a> model for building and scaling sales teams. Aaron is often re-iterating that even seemingly low customer churn rates has a huge affect on revenue growth and costs a hell of a lot of time, money and resources just to replace those that leave. So spend some time now to ensure you have enough people and resources focused on customer success to save having to spend even more later.</p>
