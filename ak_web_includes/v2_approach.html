				<div class="ak_article_column">
					<p>We aspire to be the world's best and well-known executive search firm for startup companies in the technology sector. We're not there just yet but we wake up everyday thinking of ways to be better.</p>
					<p>We believe the only way to achieve this is by consistently delivering results with flawless service that <a href="#success" class="ak_article_link">rocks our customer's world</a> and gives them no reason to go elsewhere.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="ak_article_column">
					<p>We are passionate about treating people with courtesy, honesty, decency, openness and humility. We like to work with <a href="#people" class="ak_article_link">people like us</a>; people who are smart, have acute attention to detail, do everything to the best of their ability and who aren't afraid to make mistakes, take risks or enthusiastically disagree.</p>
					<p>We strive to be outstanding because being only better than our competitors is just not good enough.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="ak_article_column">
					<p>We relish being an agonising thorn in the side of our incumbent, obstinate competitors like Korn Ferry, Heidrick &amp; Struggles or Spencer Stuart and we go out of our way to ensure nobody can accuse us of being fast-talking, slick-tongued or bland!</p>
					<p>Honestly, if you don't enjoy collaborating with partners, rewarding hard work and having fun, then we're probably not the right firm for you.</p>
