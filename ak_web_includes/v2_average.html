					<p>...unless you're committed to building unbeatable teams and crushing your competition. We don't do average because your company needs more than average. We suspect you knew that already because you're here reading this page.</p>
					<p>It's no secret that great people can be the difference to a company's success. It has been well-written and reiterated over and over again by almost every Venture Capitalist, Entrepreneur and CEO on the planet. In fact, some VCs say that a startup CEO should spend at least 50% of their time on hiring.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="ak_article_column">
					<p>So why don't many companies devote enough time and attention to hiring? Well, average is so attainable, so in reach and sometimes so seductive it's difficult to ignore, even by the most well-intentioned companies.</p>
					<p>Average is so middle of the road, neither great enough to promote nor bad enough to fire. Average teams and people will kill a startup before it's had a chance to flourish by eating away at your culture, productivity and motivation.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="ak_article_column">
					<p>Hiring amazing people will make your existing team better, they'll get everyone to step up their game and increase productivity across the board. They're able to produce almost miraculous amounts of work that you previously thought would take 10 people.</p>
					<p>We can't emphasize enough how much better it is for a company to have fewer brilliant people than many average people. And the best part; awesome people also make it easier to attract other amazing people.</p>
