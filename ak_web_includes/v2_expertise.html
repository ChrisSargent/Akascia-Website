				<h1 class="ak_article_title">Our Expertise</h1>
				<div class="ak_article_column">
					<p>A typical Akascia client designs, creates, builds, deploys and sells software, hardware or services to other businesses. They are ALWAYS awesome, usually have less than 1000 employees and have probably been around for less than 10 to 15 years. Often they are private, pre-IPO with VC funding and sometimes they are publicly-listed.</p>
					<p>If you're a VC, incubator or early-stage startup then you should definitely <a href="#contactus" class="ak_article_link">contact us</a> to find out about our equity-based fees for you or your portfolio companies.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="ak_article_column">
					<p>We really get a kick out of working with companies who are challenging larger incumbents. We understand their need for <a href="#average" class="ak_article_link">outstanding people</a> who can handle a somewhat chaotic environment; autonomous, tenacious people who don't need a department of people behind them to make a sale or resolve a support case.</p>
					<p>We've worked for companies with cloud-based, on-premise, perpetual, subscription, XaaS, indirect, direct, high-touch, channel and virtually every other license or sales model you can think of (and probably some you can't).</p>
				</div>
				<div class="ak_article_column">
					<p>Our clients often use us to find their first people in a region and generally that starts with sales staff. Once we're dialled-in to a client's culture, we are then really effective at handling most of their hiring, regardless of the department or seniority.</p>
					<p>Our extensive network and search expertise gives our customers access to the very best people from Senior Individual Contributors to VP-level across Sales, Marketing, Services, Support and Research & Engineering.</p>
