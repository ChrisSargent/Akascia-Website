					<p><span class="ak_article_question">How long have you worked in search?</span> <br />
						Since November 2000, right before the DotCom bubble burst! <br />
						<br />
						<span class="ak_article_question">What do you like most about your job?</span> <br />
						I love running a business. The marketing, strategy, defining your niche, your customer and doing your best to win business in that niche and be seen as an expert; it's tremendously rewarding. The best thing about recruiting is being able to work with really inspiring and exciting companies and people. <br />
						<br />
						<span class="ak_article_question">What do you enjoy doing in your spare time?</span> <br />
						Spare time? I'm not sure what you mean? Well, I love snowboarding and windsurfing and in the breaks between I listen to plenty of music and play guitar. And web-design - it really helps keep my creative instinct satisfied. And cooking... anything that let's me be creative to be honest. <br />
						<br />
						<span class="ak_article_question">Favourite food?</span> <br />
						Pizza! And other Italian food. I'm lucky enough to live in a place where are loads of great restaurants with different cuisines. <br />
						<br />
						<span class="ak_article_question">Favourite iPhone App?</span> <br />
						Probably the 'Tune In' internet radio app, I have it on most days. <br />
						<br />
						<span class="ak_article_question">What would you call your autobiography?</span> <br />
						I trust you to kill me. <br />
						<br />
						<span class="ak_article_question">If you had superpowers, what would they be?</span> <br />
						Flight.... definitely flying. I'd love to be reincarnated as an Eagle or something, it must be amazing to be able to fly. <br />
						<br />
						<span class="ak_article_question">Which celebrity do you most resemble?</span> <br />
						Some say Karl Pilkington, I'm not so sure. My fiancee says Bruce Willis! I say Zinedine Zidane (right up until I touch a football) <br />
						<br />
						<span class="ak_article_question">What sport(s) do you follow? Which team?</span> <br />
						I'm a religious Formula 1 fan and watcher, that's become my main sport addiction since moving away from the UK. Lewis Hamilton is my favourite driver followed by Raikonnen and Alonso. I still follow and love football (soccer!) but I don't get to watch is as much in France. <br />
						<br />
						<span class="ak_article_question">What could you not live without?</span> <br />
						Music, a guitar and sadly, my laptop. Tea and coffee... <br />
						<br />
						<span class="ak_article_question">Favourite movie?</span> <br />
						Top Gun... maybe Seven.... maybe BadBoys 2 - Steve and I can quote that all day long at each other! <br />
						<br />
						<span class="ak_article_question">Favourite holiday destination?</span> <br />
						I think Dahab in Egypt so far. I spent two weeks there last Spring and the windsurfing is amazing! <br />
						<br />
						<span class="ak_article_question">What would you do for a million bucks?</span> <br />
						Well, I'd advise against starting a search business! I reckon I could just about give up tea and coffee... <br />
						<br />
						<span class="ak_article_question">Thing that annoys you most?</span> <br />
						Bureaucracy and 'paper' rules that are utterly irrelevant... even more so the people who stick to those rules for no other reason than someone else has told them too, without asking why <br />
						<br />
						<span class="ak_article_question">Three guests for dinner – who are they?</span> <br />
						Well, I reckon I'd definitely have to crash Steve's dinner and bring three guests of my own too: Keifer Sutherland, John Cleese and Kurt Cobain.... now that would be one hell of a party! <br />
