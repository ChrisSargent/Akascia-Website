						<h3>Our approach to working with you is simply described; we treat people decently, with courtesy, honesty, openness and humility.</h3>
						<p>Our approach to executive search is thorough and considered. We believe it is the most effective way of finding the very best people in the industry. To maintain your belief in this, and therefore us, we approach every search assignment with a large commitment of our time and resources to ensure a return on your investment.</p>
						<p>Accordingly, we also have certain expectations of you and your commitment to hiring the best people. For example, some of the important questions we'll expect to be answered before we start include:</p>
					</div>
					<div class="text">
						<ul class="bulletlist">
							<li>Are you serious about improving the quality of people your company employs?</li>
							<li>Do you care that our short and long-term goals are shared?</li>
							<li>Do you understand that the success of our search somewhat depends on prompt and high quality feedback from you?</li>
							<li>Can you describe what your new employee will have achieved and how they will have progressed by the end of their first, second and fifth years?</li>
							<li>Do you have realistic expectations of who you can attract and are you sure they exist?</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="text">
						<ul class="bulletlist">
							<li>Do you trust your own intuition when it comes to an individual's potential impact on your organisation's success?</li>
							<li>Do you appreciate that we won't treat you or our candidates as commodities and we value our own and our candidates' time as much as we value yours?</li>
							<li>Do you realise that, in recruitment, timing and momentum are critical?</li>
							<li>Do you recognise that with nearly 30 years' experience in search, we're starting to get the hang of it?</li>
							<li>Are you being completely honest with us...?</li>
