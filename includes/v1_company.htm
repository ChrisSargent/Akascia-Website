						<h3>We are an international, executive search firm  focused on helping technology companies grow their business in EMEA and APAC.</h3>
						<p>We don't pretend to have a revolutionary way of helping you win the &quot;War for Talent&quot; and out of respect for our customers and ourselves, we don't use unqualified superlatives to describe what we do. We don't over complicate what we do and we don't get distracted by new fads and trends in talent management.</p>
						<p>The essence and strength of our firm is in our passion and approach to   executive search and the way in which we deal with our clients and   candidates. That is why you should work with us.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="text">
						<p class="highlight">If you insist on comparing us to other search firms, there are some things we'd like to say about ourselves:</p>
						<ul class="bulletlist">
							<li>Executive search, purely done. To us, this means three things: We only do executive search, we only do it using proven headhunting and networking techniques and we just get it done.</li>
							<li>We don't boast about a &quot;75% completion rate&quot;; we'd be embarrassed if it was that low.</li>
							<li>We enjoy being disruptive and challenging. We believe the only way to stand out is to stand for something special. Once you start working with us, you'll know what we mean.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="text">
						<ul class="bulletlist">
							<li>All our searches are Director-led, we have a select client base to reduce off-limits issues and we only take on searches we know we can complete within your timescales.</li>
							<li>We haven't worked in blue-chip, managerial roles and we have an aversion to wearing suits! However, we are experts in search, finding the un-findable and we know what types of people it takes to run a successful business.</li>
							<li>We are supported by an advisory board with more than a century's worth of expertise from key disciplines in the technology arena. <a href="../../documents/akascia_advisory_board.pdf" target="_blank" class="highlight bold">Read more.</a></li>
