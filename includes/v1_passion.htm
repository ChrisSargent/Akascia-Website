						<h3>Getting it right is our passion.</h3>
						<p>Our goal of satisfying the needs of the most discerning, demanding executives in their search for new people drives us beyond any single transaction. We're also passionate about our approach; that of being open and casual whilst remaining absolutely serious about what we do.</p>
						<p>We relish being an agonising thorn in the side of our traditional, obstinate competitors like Korn Ferry, Heidrick &amp; Struggles and Spencer Stuart.</p>
						<p>Our passion and approach are the essence of our firm and the following points help to define that a little more.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="text">
						<ul class="bulletlist">
							<li>We aim to contradict the stereotypical, fast-talking recruiters and we are far from being corporate animals! (If you want a corporate machine churning through your searches, you should probably use one of our competitors.)</li>
							<li>We like to think that we are the best executive search firm in our field yet we still wake up every day thinking of ways to be better.</li>
							<li>Being only better than our competitors is simply not good enough.</li>
							<li>Like your best employees, we don't give up until we deliver results.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="text">
						<ul class="bulletlist">
							<li>We are entrepreneurs and we like to work with people like us; people who are serious about what they do, have acute attention to detail and do everything to the best of their ability.</li>
							<li>We love finding the best people for the best jobs and the thought of making your company more successful whilst doing it.</li>
							<li>We appreciate that knowing what our customers need, goes beyond understanding what they want... then we give them both.</li>
							<li>We trust that our passion for what we do will inspire you to hire better people.</li>
