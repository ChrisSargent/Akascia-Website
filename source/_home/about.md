Yes, it's true... unfortunately Akascia Executive Search has closed down and our founders are now pursuing new activities. It was one hell of a ride and we'd like to thank all our previous clients, candidates, customers, friends and everyone else we met along the way for all their support.

We still strongly believe that executive search is the best way to find the very best people for all companies, from startups to the biggest blue chips, so we strongly encourage you to consider using a search firm when hiring someone new.

Chris and Steve do still take on some private assignments, so if you have a really juicy need to find someone new, just drop them a quick line to <info@akascia.com> and they will do all they can to help out.

In case you're interested, [Chris](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/chrissargent) is now running a web design and development company called [Sticky Pixel](http://www.stickypixel.com) from his base in the South of France and [Steve](https://au.linkedin.com/in/stevebett) is now helping Dell find the best and brightest people across APAC as a Senior Talent Advisor.

Goodbye for now and godspeed,

Chris, Steve and the Akascia crew.
